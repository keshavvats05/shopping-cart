## About the project

## Working of the project

### Authenticaion
This project has an authentication page where user can either Login or Signup.
The authentication is done using Firebase & only after a successful authenticaion the user can enter in the home page of the application.
The project uses autoLogin features that enables user to automatically login in case the website is refreshed.
Also it provides autoLogout features that makes user to automatically logout after some specified amount of time.
When a user does login or signup the Firebase sends some data like email, token and tokenExpirationTime.
#### AutoLogin
The data sent by Firebase is stored inside the localStorage of the browser so that it can't be deleted during a refresh and that data is used to autoLogin the user after a refresh.
#### AutoLogout
The Firebase also sends the tokenExpirationTime, after this time the token becomes invalid and the user is autoLogged out of the applicaion.
However user can perform a self logout by clicking on the logout button

#### Data storage
The data is stored inside the JSON file (data.JSON) inside the assets folder.

## Home
After a successful authenticaion, the user enters in the home page.
At first, the data is fetched from the data.JSON file present inside the assets folder.
Inside the home page, the user can perform the following actions
1.Add items to cart.
2.update the item's quantity.
3.Remove the item from the cart.
4.Checkout the items in the cart
5.And can finally logout of the application

#### CheckOut
CheckOut is a dynamic component.
It is enabled after the user clicks the checkOut button in home page.
It is backdrop that hides rest of the page.
The checkOut component display the Price details (number of items and its price, discount, delivery charges and total amount).
The user can click the close button inside the checkouk backdrop to close the component.

## Logout
Finally, user can logout and the item added to the cart along with its price details is stored inside the local storage of the browser.
After logout, the user authentication data(token, tokenExpirationTime etc.) is removed from the local storage and the user needs to authenticate again for enterting inside the home page.
